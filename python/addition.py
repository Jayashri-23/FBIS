# ARITHMATI OPERATOR
# Addition of two number
a = 2
b = 20

c= a+b
print("addition is:",c)

# # subtraction of two number
c=b-a
print("substraction is",c)

# # multiplication
c = a * b
print("multiplication is:",c)

# # Division 
c = b / a
print("Division is:",c)

# # Exponentiation operator
base=2
power=3
print("output is:", base**power)

# Moldulus of two number
c=a%b   #used to find remainder of the division
print("modulus is:", c)

# # Take input from user
name = input("Enter your name:")
print(name)

# Floor Division of number
# used to find the Quotient of the division
c = a // b
print(c)

# 2. COMPARISON OPERATOR is used to compare two values
#   i)Equal to operator
x=20
y=10
z = x==y
print("x is equal to y:" ,z)      # 1st method
print("x is equal to y :",x==y)  # 2nd method to print
   
#  ii)  Less than operator
print("x is Less than to y :",x<y)

#   iii) Greaterthan operator
print("x is greater than y :",x>y)

# iv) Lessthan og equal to operator
print("x is less than or equal to y:" , x<=y)

# v) Greater than or equal to operator
print("x is greater than or equal to y:", x <= y)

# vi) Not equal to operator
print("x is not equal to y:", x!=y)

# 3.LOGICAL OPERATOR
#  i)AND operator
result = x>50 and y>50
print("output of AND operator is :" ,result)

# ii) OR operator
print("The output of OR operator is:" , x<30 or y<5)

# iii) NOT operator
print("The output of NOT operator is:", not x<2 )
 
result = not(x<2)
print("resut of NOT operator is:", result)
